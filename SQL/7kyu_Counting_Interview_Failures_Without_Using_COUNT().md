## Problem Description

We have a PostgreSQL DB table `interview_failures`. This table contains information about various unfortunate reasons candidates failed their interviews:

- `candidate_name` (varchar): name of the candidate.
- `failure_reason` (varchar): reason for the interview failure.
- `interview_date` (date): date of the interview.

### Objective

You need to find the total number of interview failures grouped by the `failure_reason` in the `interview_failures` table **without using the `COUNT()` function** or relying on any auto-incrementing ID column.

### Result Set

The result set should contain the following columns:

- `failure_reason` (varchar): reason for the interview failure.
- `cnt` (int): count of the employees who failed because of that reason.

Order the results by `cnt` in **descending order**. If the count is the same for multiple reasons, order them alphabetically by the `failure_reason`.

### Sample Data:

| candidate_name  | failure_reason                                          | interview_date |

| Stephen Fry     | Didn't know the difference between inner and left joins | 2023-06-19     |

### Expected Output:

| failure_reason                                           | cnt |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Claimed to be a Python expert but couldn't write a loop   | 2   |
| Claimed to be fluent in binary but spoke in octal         | 1   |
| Confused HTML with a programming language                | 1   |
| Didn't know the difference between inner and left joins  | 1   |
| Pasted Stack Overflow code without understanding it       | 1   |

### Solution

```sql
SELECT
  failure_reason,
  SUM(1) AS cnt
FROM
  interview_failures
GROUP BY
  failure_reason
ORDER BY
  cnt DESC,
  failure_reason ASC
```
