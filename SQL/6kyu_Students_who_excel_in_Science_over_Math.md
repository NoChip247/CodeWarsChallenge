Let's consider a case where we have a students table and a courses table. The tables have the following structure:

**students:**

| id  | name     | email               |
|-----|----------|---------------------|
| 1   | John     | john@example.com    |
| 2   | Sarah    | sarah@example.com   |
| 3   | Robert   | robert@example.com  |
...

**courses:**

| id  | student_id | course_name | score |
|-----|------------|-------------|-------|
| 1   | 1          | Math        | 90    |
| 2   | 1          | Science     | 85    |
| 3   | 2          | Math        | 92    |
| 4   | 2          | Science     | 80    |
...

We need to find the students who have a higher score in Science than in Math.  

Your SQL query should return the `student_id`, `name` (the name of the student), and his or her difference in scores between these courses (named as `score_difference`).  

Order the result by the difference in scores in descending order, and if difference is the same, then by `student_id` in ascending order.  

**Good Luck!**

### Desired Output

The desired output should look like this:

| student_id | name   | score_difference |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| 3          | Robert | 25               |
| 5          | Emma   | 3                |
| 6          | Olivia | 2                |
| 10         | James  | 2                |

---

### Solution

```sql
SELECT
  c.student_id,
  s.name,
  MAX(CASE WHEN course_name = 'Science' THEN score END) - MAX(CASE WHEN course_name = 'Math' THEN score END) AS score_difference # Ca donne (le plus haut score quand le cours est "Science") - (le plus haut score quand le cours est "Math")
FROM students AS s
LEFT JOIN courses AS c
  ON s.id = c.student_id
GROUP BY student_id, s.name
HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN course_name = 'Science' THEN score END) - MAX(CASE WHEN course_name = 'Math' THEN score END) > 0
ORDER BY score_difference DESC, student_id ASC
```
